	By winning its appeal at the South Jakarta District Court on Wednesday (17/2), PT. Carrefour Indonesia successfully defended its right to acquire PT. Alfa Retailindo Tbk.

	<br>&nbsp;<br>

	Carrefour, which at one time controlled 46.30 % of Indonesia’s upstream retail market, was targeted by the Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition (‘KPPU’) after acquiring Alfa Retailindo, thereby increasing Carrefour’s market share to 57.99 %.

	<br>&nbsp;<br>

	After the acquisition of Alfa Retailindo, on 3 November 2009 the KPPU issued Decision No. 09/KPPU-L/2009, which ordered Carrefour to pay a fine of IDR 25 billion, and divest its shares in the acquired retailer.

	<br>&nbsp;<br>

	According to the KPPU, Carrefour’s acquisition caused a violation towards Articles 17 (1) and 25 (1) (a) of Law No. 5 of 1999 on the Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Business Competition.

	As allowed by that Law, Carrefour appealed the Decision at the court of first instance – the South Jakarta District Court – as Case No. 1598/Pdt.G/2009/PN.Jkt.Sel. At least for now, its legal victory in that case allows it to continue business as usual, free from divestitures and fines.



	However, the battle may not be over. Ahmad Junaidi, the Director of Communication for the KPPU, told hukumonline (17/2) that after assessing the District Court’s decision, they will request cassation of the case to the Supreme Court.



	“Despite the decision of the district court, we still see our [3 November 2009] Decision as having used the correct legal basis, as well as being based on the facts,” said Mr. Junaidi.
